--------------------The Sign--------------------
INITIAL
You wake up -- on an icy ground to a cold breeze gushing at you from every direction, the air is dry. You look up and there are mountain ranges surrounding you from lengths of 2,400 km. The feeling of confusion is creeping up on you -- "how did I get here?" A wooden board on your far left says, "Welcome to the Himalayas," but there is no one to be found. The view is beautiful yet ominous since ice caps are melting around you and the famous Himalayan black-necked cranes skull is surrounding you in masses. You find yourself in loss of words as you see a village flooded from afar.
NORMAL
You are back at the sign.
